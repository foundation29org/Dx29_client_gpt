      "description": "DxGPT is an augmented intelligence tool designed by and for the clinical environment. Unlike general-purpose AIs, it does not generate open narrative text, but a structured analysis of five diagnostic hypotheses, classified and reasoned with symptoms for and against. We use advanced language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5, within a medical control framework that ensures relevance, consistency, and safety in every result. We do not replace clinical judgment: we enhance it. We offer you an instant differential analysis that saves time, neutralizes cognitive biases, and raises the quality of clinical reasoning from the very first moment."

    "challenge": {
      "title": "The challenge of clinical diagnosis",
      "description": "Diagnosis, especially in rare diseases, is a labyrinth of data and symptoms that consumes time and generates uncertainty. With over 10,000 rare diseases, most unknown to the average professional due to their low prevalence, familiarity is an impossible luxury. DxGPT acts as a powerful cognitive offloading tool, speeding up analysis and broadening the spectrum of possibilities to arrive at an accurate diagnosis sooner. In this context, support technology is no longer an option, but a necessity for patient safety and quality of care."

      "P1_Title": "DxGPT",
      "P1_Summary_P1": "DxGPT is a diagnostic support tool designed by and for the clinical environment. Unlike general-purpose AIs, it does not provide open-ended answers, but rather a structured analysis of five diagnostic hypotheses, reasoned and ranked. We use the most advanced technology, like OpenAIâs o3, within a medical oversight framework that ensures the relevance and safety of every result. We do not replace the doctor; we offer an instant second opinion, designed to save time, reduce bias, and elevate the quality of clinical reasoning from the start.",

      "P1.S1.T": "The challenge of clinical diagnosis",
      "P1.S1.B1.Q": "What core problem does DxGPT solve?",
      "P1.S1.B1.A_P1": "Medical diagnosis, especially for rare diseases, is a slow and complex process. Professionals must analyze countless symptoms and data, which can delay treatment and create uncertainty. DxGPT acts as a powerful cognitive aid, streamlining this process to reach an accurate diagnosis sooner.",
      "P1.S1.B2.Q": "Why are rare diseases such a big challenge?",
      "P1.S1.B2.A_P1": "There are over 10,000 rare diseases, most of which are unfamiliar to the average clinician due to their low frequency. This lack of familiarity makes diagnosis a major challenge. Supportive technology is no longer a luxury but a necessity to improve accuracy and care quality in these cases.",

      "P1.S2.T": "Why DxGPT instead of a general-purpose AI",
      "P1.S2.B1.Q": "How is DxGPT different from using a chatbot like ChatGPT?",
      "P1.S2.B1.A_P1": "DxGPT transforms differential diagnosis because it is designed with a specific clinical purpose. Instead of an open consultation, you get five structured, reasoned, and ranked diagnostic hypotheses using standards like ICD-10. Itâs a supervised environment applying advanced AI within a safe, diagnosis-oriented framework.",
      "P1.S2.B2.Q": "What specific advantages does this specialized approach offer?",
      "P1.S2.B2.A_P1": "DxGPTâs clinical design offers direct benefits:",
      "P1.S2.B2.A_L1.I1": "Time saving: Diagnosis is practically immediate.",
      "P1.S2.B2.A_L1.I2": "Clinical clarity: Each hypothesis includes explicit compatible and incompatible symptoms.",
      "P1.S2.B2.A_L1.I3": "Optimized interface: Designed for medical decision-making, not freeform exploration.",
      "P1.S2.B2.A_L1.I4": "Bias reduction: Reduces availability bias, ensuring rare diagnoses are not overlooked.",
      "P1.S2.B2.A_L1.I5": "Consistency and validation: The same case always receives an equally rigorous analysis, continuously validated with our proprietary clinical benchmark.",
      "P1.S2.B3.Q": "So, what is the future of AI in medicine?",
      "P1.S2.B3.A_P1": "The future wonât be a single system for everything, but an ecosystem of specialized, medically validated solutions like DxGPT. Using it today means actively shaping how AI is built and validated in medicine from real clinical practice.",

      "P1.S3.T": "Real impact: integration in healthcare systems",
      "P1.S3.Intro_P1": "DxGPT is already being integrated into public healthcare systems to help doctors improve the diagnosis of rare diseases in daily clinical practice. Here are our current and upcoming deployments:",
      "P1.S3.B1.T": "Pioneering Implementation: Madrid Health Service (SERMAS)",
      "P1.S3.B1.Content_P1": "Since September 2023, the Madrid Health Service (SERMAS) has pioneered the implementation of DxGPT for over 6,000 Primary Care doctors in the Community of Madrid. This initiative has improved both the speed and accuracy of diagnosing rare diseases, significantly reducing the time needed to refer patients to appropriate specialists.",
      "P1.S3.B1.RelatedLink1": "Madrid Health Service pioneers Generative AI for improving diagnosis in rare disease patients",
      "P1.S3.B1.RelatedLink2": "Madrid enables over 6,000 Primary Care doctors to access AI for rare disease diagnosis",
      "P1.S3.B2.T": "In Progress: CatSalut (Catalonia)",
      "P1.S3.B2.Content_P1": "We are currently working to implement DxGPT in the Catalan healthcare system (CatSalut), aiming to bring this innovative tool to healthcare professionals in Catalonia to improve rare disease diagnosis in the region.",
      "P1.S3.B3.T": "Aragonese Health Service",
      "P1.S3.B3.Content_P1": "DxGPT is already available for healthcare professionals in the Aragonese Health Service, allowing them to improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosing rare and common diseases in the region of AragÃ³n.",

      "P2_Title": "Benchmarking",
      "P2_Summary_P1": "For an AI tool to be clinically useful, it must be rigorously evaluated. We do not settle for generic metrics; we have built, processed, and validated our own test bank: DxGPT-bench. This set of 997 statistically representative and diverse clinical cases allows us to measure language model accuracy in realistic scenarios, ensuring DxGPT is built on solid and transparent evidence.",

      "P2.S1.T": "Creating DxGPT-bench: our data",
      "P2.S1.B1.Q": "Where does the benchmark data come from?",
      "P2.S1.B1.A_P1": "Our database integrates five complementary sources to cover a broad spectrum of medical practice:",
      "P2.S1.B1.A_L1.I1": "Real emergency cases from HM Hospitales in Madrid.",
      "P2.S1.B1.A_L1.I2": "USMLE-style medical training questions.",
      "P2.S1.B1.A_L1.I3": "Synthetic rare disease cases from the RAMEDIS system (based on OMIM and ORPHA).",
      "P2.S1.B1.A_L1.I4": "Real and supervised medical records of Ukrainian patients with rare conditions (e.g., juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, nsLTP syndrome), weighted more heavily in the system.",
      "P2.S1.B2.Q": "How were these heterogeneous data processed?",
      "P2.S1.B2.A_P1": "Preprocessing was critical. A normalization pipeline was applied to correct inconsistencies, and GPT-4 was used to filter out non-evaluable cases (e.g., implicit diagnoses or theoretical questions). All diagnoses were labeled with ICD-10 codes to measure diversity in a standardized way.",
      "P2.S1.B3.Q": "How were the final 997 cases selected?",
      "P2.S1.B3.A_P1": "Once the 'datalake' of over 9,500 cases was consolidated, we used a stratified selection algorithm. It extracted an optimal set of 997 cases maximizing diagnostic (ICD-10) coverage and ensuring a uniform distribution of complexity and severity, with significant representation from minority data sources.",

      "P2.S2.T": "Statistical validation of DxGPT-bench",
      "P2.S2.B1.Q": "Why use 997 cases instead of the original 9,583?",
      "P2.S2.B1.A_P1": "The reduction is deliberate and statistically justified. The original set had high redundancy (e.g., 2,373 cases of 'pain'). Our final sample (10.4%) eliminates that redundancy but captures 31.8% of unique diagnoses (908 ICD-10 codes) and 43.3% of unique symptoms (1,210), preserving essential diversity.",
      "P2.S2.B2.Q": "Is this sample sufficient to evaluate varying case difficulty?",
      "P2.S2.B2.A_P1": "Yes. Stratification by complexity and severity ensures full spectrum coverage, from the simplest cases (C0/S0) to the most complex (C10/S10). Though the rarest strata have few cases (2 in C10), the most populated ones (180 in C5) provide robust statistical power for key model comparisons.",
      "P2.S2.B3.Q": "Why not use an even larger dataset for validation?",
      "P2.S2.B3.A_P1": "Given the significant computational cost, we prioritized dataset optimization. Expanding it to cover 100% of ICD-10 codes would mostly add very rare variants with marginal impact on model benchmarking, at prohibitive cost. Our approach provides a comprehensive evaluation with reasonable resources.",

      "P2.S3.T": "Evaluation process and results",
      "P2.S3.B1.Q": "How is a language model evaluated with DxGPT-bench?",
      "P2.S3.B1.A_P1": "The process is automated:",
      "P2.S3.B1.A_L1.I1": "The model generates diagnoses for each benchmark case.",
      "P2.S3.B1.A_L1.I2": "These are compared to the correct diagnosis using semantic similarity, either with a BERT model specialized in the clinical domain or a reasoning language model.",
      "P2.S3.B1.A_L1.I3": "Each diagnosis is assigned a severity level.",
      "P2.S3.B1.A_L1.I4": "A distance is calculated between the severity of generated diagnoses and the correct one.",
      "P2.S3.B1.A_P2": "These well-classified metrics allow extraction of not only global accuracy scores but also diagnostic optimism metrics and stratification of the original points to visualize various correlations.",
      "P2.S3.B2.Q": "Has DxGPT been validated against doctors in a clinical study?",
      "P2.S3.B2.A_P1": "Yes. Sant Joan de DÃ©u Hospital has conducted a thorough clinical study. Results show DxGPT achieves diagnostic accuracy comparable to expert clinicians. This work has been published as a preprint and is under peer review. You can read the full study here:",

    "testi1": "I am convinced that this application can simplify the complexity of the healthcare process, without affecting the quality of care, which is the great challenge of any technological solution when approaching the healthcare world. Moreover, as the application is completely free, any healthcare professional or patient can use it regardless of the economic implications and without compromising the privacy and security of its users.",
    "testi2": "A good assistant that complements our capacity for differential diagnosis, especially in those patients with less prevalent diseases, where it is not always possible to keep in mind all the diagnostic possibilities that make up a given conjunction of symptoms, signs and complementary tests.",
    "testi3": "This tool is truly exceptional. It delivers precise and accurate information, which is immensely valuable. What sets it apart is its capability to suggest additional symptoms crucial for diagnosis. It doesn't provide any misleading or biased information. I'm thoroughly impressed by its accuracy and helpfulness. Highly recommended for anyone seeking reliable diagnostic support.",
    "testi4": "This is wonderful!! It would have taken HOURS to give all of my info to a doctor to even start on a diagnosis. I've suspected MS for a little while now, and it was the top possibility. Really, thank you for this!!.",
    "testi5": "Loved it, I am not an MD so I am aware of the limitations but still found it to be incredibly intuitive and it was quite helpful for a non medical professional to gain insightâ¦ Excellent APP.",
