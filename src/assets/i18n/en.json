      "t1": "What is DxGPT?",
      "p1": "DxGPT is a cutting-edge diagnostic decision support software built on the GPT-4 AI language model developed by OpenAI. Our goal is to assist healthcare professionals by generating a list of possible diseases from a description of symptoms. While powerful, our model is not perfect and should not be used as a replacement for professional medical advice.",
      "t2": "How It Works",
      "p2": "When you input a patient's symptoms, DxGPT uses advanced AI models to generate a list of potential diagnoses. This initial list is a starting point. To refine the diagnosis, clinicians should gather additional information such as clinical data, lab tests, and the patient's medical history. Your feedback is crucial in helping us improve DxGPT's accuracy and usability.",
      "t3": "Our commitment to improvement",
      "p3": "We are continuously working on new features to enhance DxGPT. Collaboration is at the heart of our mission, and we are eager to partner with researchers and healthcare professionals interested in exploring the potential of AI in diagnostics. If you're interested in collaborating, please reach out to us.",
      "t4": "Transparency and collaboration",
      "p4": "In our pursuit of transparency and collaboration, we have made the source code of DxGPT available to the public. You can explore and contribute to our client and server repositories on GitHub. We believe that open collaboration with the scientific community will drive innovation and improve rare disease diagnostics.",
      "t5": "Model accuracy",
      "p5.1": "DxGPT, a diagnostic support tool based on GPT-4, has demonstrated promising accuracy in preliminary evaluations. In a study using 200 synthetic rare disease cases, DxGPT achieved 67.5% strict accuracy (correct diagnosis as the top suggestion) and 88.5% top-5 accuracy (correct diagnosis within the top five suggestions)[3][4].",
      "p5.2": "However, performance varied across different datasets and models:",
      "p5.2.1": "On synthetic cases, closed models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini showed relatively high accuracy, while open models like Llama 3 and Mixtral performed reasonably well but lagged behind[1].",
      "p5.2.2": "For real-world RAMEDIS rare disease cases, Claude 3 Opus model achieved 55% strict accuracy and 70% top-5 accuracy, outperforming other closed models[1].",
      "p5.2.3": "The PUMCH dataset proved challenging for all models, with the highest strict accuracy at 59.46% (GPT-4 Turbo 1106) and top-5 accuracy at 64.86%[1].",
      "p5.3": "Currently, new frontier models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3.1 405b are being tested by our research team and these results will be updated in a future paper.",
      "p5.4": "Here are some initial results of GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet compared to the other models from our last paper:",
      "p5.5": "In this graph, the green and orange bars correspond respectively to P1 (probability of hitting the first diagnosis) and P5 (probability of hitting among the 5 diagnoses).",
      "p5.6": "Furthermore, the black line is the difference in accuracy between common diseases (top) and rare diseases (bottom).",
      "p5.7": "It's crucial to emphasize that DxGPT is still in development and is intended as a decision support tool, not a replacement for professional medical judgment[1][5]. The tool aims to assist healthcare professionals by generating diagnostic hypotheses based on patient symptoms and clinical data, potentially reducing the time to diagnosis for rare and common diseases[2][5]. Further validation on real clinical data and comparison with human expert diagnoses are necessary to fully assess its performance and potential impact on patient care[1][4]. We are also conducting these studies within hospitals and the first results will be published soon.",

      "q2": "Can I use DxGPT for emergency situations?",
      "a2": "No, DxGPT is not intended for emergency situations. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services immediately.",
      "q3": "How does DxGPT make its diagnosis?",
      "a3": "DxGPT is like a computer that has read millions of medical books and papers. When you type in your symptoms, it looks through all this information it has read. Then, it lists illnesses that match your symptoms based on all this medical knowledge. It's not a doctor and doesn't diagnose anything - it shares what it learned from all its 'reading.' Always see a real doctor for actual medical advice.",
      "q4": "Can I speak to a human doctor through DxGPT?",
      "a4": "Currently, DxGPT is fully automated and does not provide direct access to human doctors. We strongly recommend following up with your healthcare provider for any medical concerns.",
      "q5": "Is DxGPT available worldwide?",
      "a5": "Yes, DxGPT is accessible globally. However, please be aware that medical practices and terminologies may vary between countries.",
      "q6": "How often is DxGPT's medical knowledge updated?",
      "a6": "DxGPT doesn't update its knowledge in the traditional sense. Instead, our team is always testing the newest and best medical AI models available. We look at how well each model understands and suggests diagnoses for different medical situations. Our goal is to find the best parts of each model and combine them to make DxGPT's suggestions as helpful as possible.",
      "a6.1": "Additionally, we're exploring new techniques to improve accuracy even further. We're also conducting clinical studies with both public and private hospitals to test and validate DxGPT's performance in real-world medical settings.",
      "a6.2": "This ongoing process means that while DxGPT's core knowledge doesn't change directly, the way it uses that knowledge to make suggestions is constantly improving. We're always working to make DxGPT better at helping doctors and patients understand possible diagnoses.",
      "q7": "How can I provide feedback on DxGPT?",
      "a7": "Your feedback is invaluable for improving DxGPT. You can provide feedback directly through the application or contact us via our website. Your insights help us refine the model and enhance its accuracy and usability.",
      "q8": "Who can collaborate with DxGPT's development?",
