      "t0": "What problem does DxGPT solve?",
      "p0.1": "Medical diagnosis, especially for rare diseases, can be a complex and lengthy process. Doctors often need to review multiple symptoms, medical history, and test results, which can make reaching the correct diagnosis challenging. This not only delays appropriate treatment for the patient but also increases uncertainty in the decision-making process.",
      "p0.2": "In the case of rare diseases, the challenge is even greater, as many doctors have little to no direct experience with these uncommon conditions. Therefore, access to tools that help generate potential diagnoses can be crucial to improving the quality of medical care.",
      "t1": "How does DxGPT solve it?",
      "p1.1": "DxGPT uses advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology based on GPT-4 language models, developed by OpenAI. When a healthcare professional inputs a patient’s symptoms, DxGPT generates a list of possible diagnoses based on those symptoms.",
      "p1.2": "This not only saves time but can also help reduce errors, providing doctors with a foundation to investigate potential diseases, both common and rare. While DxGPT doesn’t replace medical judgment, it serves as a valuable support, offering initial hypotheses that doctors can use alongside other clinical data and tests.",
      "p1.3": "The purpose of this tool is to facilitate the work of healthcare professionals, making it more efficient and accurate, enabling them to focus on the most probable options from the start and reducing the time to reach a definitive diagnosis.",
      "t2": "How It Works",
      "p2": "When you input a patient's symptoms, DxGPT uses advanced AI models to generate a list of potential diagnoses. This initial list is a starting point. To refine the diagnosis, clinicians should gather additional information such as clinical data, lab tests, and the patient's medical history. Your feedback is crucial in helping us improve DxGPT's accuracy and usability.",
      "t3": "Our commitment to improvement",
      "p3": "We are continuously working on new features to enhance DxGPT. Collaboration is at the heart of our mission, and we are eager to partner with researchers and healthcare professionals interested in exploring the potential of AI in diagnostics. If you're interested in collaborating, please reach out to us.",
      "t4": "Transparency and collaboration",
      "p4": "In our pursuit of transparency and collaboration, we have made the source code of DxGPT available to the public.

The results of this study indicate that DxGPT's performance is equivalent to that of a qualified medical professional. You can find more details about this study at this link:",
      "t6": "Technical details about DxGPT accuracy",
      "p6.1": "Rigorous evaluations ensure AI diagnostic tools are reliable for real-world medical use.",
      "p6.2": "DxGPT [3], a diagnostic support tool based on GPT-4 family of AI models, has shown promising results in diagnosing rare diseases. When multiple available models were tested on real-world rare disease cases from the RAMEDIS dataset:",
      "p6.2.1": "Claude 3 Opus performed best among previously tested models, achieving 55% strict accuracy (correct diagnosis as the top suggestion) and 70% top-5 accuracy (correct diagnosis within the top five suggestions) [1][2]",
      "p6.3": "New frontier models, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, are currently being evaluated [4]. Early results on the RAMEDIS dataset suggest these models may offer slight improvements:",
      "p6.3.1": "GPT-4o: ~56% strict accuracy, ~68% top-5 accuracy",
      "p6.3.2": "Claude 3.5 Sonnet: ~60% strict accuracy, ~67% top-5 accuracy",
      "p6.4": "Importantly, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet are significantly faster and more cost-effective than their predecessors like Claude 3 Opus or GPT-4. This increased efficiency means that these advanced diagnostic capabilities could potentially be offered for free to a much larger number of users worldwide, greatly expanding access to AI-assisted rare disease diagnosis.",
      "p6.5": "Moreover, both GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet have set new records in diagnosing common diseases. In our tests using the Urgency dataset for common conditions, both models achieved an impressive top-5 accuracy of around 89%. This demonstrates that these AI models are not only making strides in rare disease diagnosis but are also highly capable when it comes to more frequently encountered medical conditions [4].",
      "p6.6": "These findings indicate that the latest AI models are making significant progress in both rare and common disease diagnosis while becoming more accessible, which could have a substantial impact on global healthcare.",
      "p6.7": "Here are some initial results of GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet compared to the other models from our last paper:",
      "p6.8": "In this graph, the green and orange bars correspond respectively to strict accuracy (probability of hitting the first diagnosis) and top-5 accuracy (probability of hitting among the 5 diagnoses).",
      "p6.9": "Furthermore, the black line is the difference in accuracy between common diseases (top) and rare diseases (bottom).",
      "p6.10": "It's crucial to emphasize that DxGPT is still in development and is intended as a decision support tool, not a replacement for professional medical judgment[1][5]. The tool aims to assist healthcare professionals by generating diagnostic hypotheses based on patient symptoms and clinical data, potentially reducing the time to diagnosis for rare and common diseases[2][5]. Further validation on real clinical data and comparison with human expert diagnoses are necessary to fully assess its performance and potential impact on patient care[1][4].

    "testi1": "I am convinced that this application can simplify the complexity of the healthcare process, without affecting the quality of care, which is the great challenge of any technological solution when approaching the healthcare world. Moreover, as the application is completely free, any healthcare professional or patient can use it regardless of the economic implications and without compromising the privacy and security of its users.",
    "testi2": "A good assistant that complements our capacity for differential diagnosis, especially in those patients with less prevalent diseases, where it is not always possible to keep in mind all the diagnostic possibilities that make up a given conjunction of symptoms, signs and complementary tests.",
    "testi3": "This tool is truly exceptional. It delivers precise and accurate information, which is immensely valuable. What sets it apart is its capability to suggest additional symptoms crucial for diagnosis. It doesn’t provide any misleading or biased information. I’m thoroughly impressed by its accuracy and helpfulness. Highly recommended for anyone seeking reliable diagnostic support.",
    "testi4": "This is wonderful!! It would have taken HOURS to give all of my info to a doctor to even start on a diagnosis. I’ve suspected MS for a little while now, and it was the top possibility. Really, thank you for this!!.",
    "testi5": "Loved it, I am not an MD so I am aware of the limitations but still found it to be incredibly intuitive and it was quite helpful for a non medical professional to gain insight… Excellent APP.",
