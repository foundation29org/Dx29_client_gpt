      "HERO_PILL_2": "Safety and clinical validation",
      "HERO_PILL_3": "Integration into health systems",
      "INTRO_TEXT": "DxGPT is an augmented intelligence tool designed by and for the clinical environment. Unlike general-purpose AIs, it does not generate open narrative text, but a structured analysis of five diagnostic hypotheses, classified and reasoned with symptoms for and against. We use advanced language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5, within a medical control framework that ensures relevance, consistency, and safety in every result. We do not replace clinical judgment: we enhance it. We offer you an instant differential analysis that saves time, neutralizes cognitive biases, and raises the quality of clinical reasoning from the very first moment.",
      "CHALLENGE_TITLE": "The challenge of clinical diagnosis",
      "CHALLENGE_TEXT": "Diagnosis, especially in rare diseases, is a labyrinth of data and symptoms that consumes time and generates uncertainty. With over 10,000 rare diseases, most unknown to the average professional due to their low prevalence, familiarity is an impossible luxury. DxGPT acts as a powerful cognitive offloading tool, speeding up analysis and broadening the spectrum of possibilities to arrive at an accurate diagnosis sooner. In this context, support technology is no longer an option, but a necessity for patient safety and quality of care.",
      "WHY_TITLE": "Why DxGPT and not a general-purpose AI?",
      "WHY_TEXT": "Conversational tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini are broad-spectrum language models. In the medical context, this flexibility is a fundamental weakness. Their unstructured nature can generate variable, incomplete, or clinically irrelevant responses, lacking the essential safety controls for high-risk decision-making.",
      "DIFF_SECTION_TITLE": "Key Differentiators of DxGPT",
      "DIFF_1_TITLE": "Structured and consistent analysis",
      "DIFF_1_TEXT": "While a generalist AI produces free text, DxGPT offers a rigorous and reproducible analysis of five diagnostic hypotheses. Each hypothesis includes compatible and incompatible symptoms, a format designed to challenge biases such as confirmation and availability bias. Our control over the instruction the model receives (the prompt) ensures consistent, reliable, and explainable results.",
      "DIFF_2_TITLE": "Clinical control framework",
      "DIFF_2_TEXT": "DxGPT operates within a control environment designed to mitigate the risks inherent in large language models (LLMs). Its architecture and results are supervised by healthcare professionals to ensure that the responses are not only technically correct, but also clinically relevant and safe.",
      "DIFF_3_TITLE": "Specialization in rare diseases",
      "DIFF_3_TEXT": "DxGPT is designed to systematically include rare diseases in the differential diagnosis, an area where generalist systems, and often human reasoning, can fail. The system integrates specialized knowledge to detect atypical patterns and explore hypotheses that would otherwise be ignored, expanding the clinician's diagnostic radar and improving the chances of an early and accurate diagnosis.",
      "IMPL_TITLE": "Implementation in healthcare providers",

This efficiency frees up the healthcare professional to focus on clinical judgment, patient communication, and decision-making.",
      "BENEFITS_2_TITLE": "From data chaos to diagnostic clarity",
      "BENEFITS_2_TEXT": "We present information in a clean, structured format, designed for clinical thinking. Hypotheses are displayed with symptoms for and against, allowing for quick evaluation and safer, more informed decision-making.",
      "BENEFITS_3_TITLE": "A tool, not an application",
      "BENEFITS_3_TEXT": "Unlike conversational AIs, DxGPT's interface is optimized for a single function: supporting diagnosis. Every element is designed to guide clinical reasoning efficiently and safely, eliminating distractions and focusing on practical utility.",
      "BENEFITS_4_TITLE": "A safety system against mental shortcuts",
      "BENEFITS_4_TEXT": "Clinical diagnosis is vulnerable to cognitive biases such as availability or confirmation bias. DxGPT acts as an objective counterweight, systematically presenting a range of possibilities based on the case evidence, including rare diseases. This promotes a more thorough evaluation and reduces the risk of diagnostic errors, improving patient safety.",
      "BENEFITS_5_TITLE": "Standardize diagnostic excellence",
      "BENEFITS_5_TEXT": "DxGPT ensures that each case is analyzed with the same methodological rigor, regardless of the professional or the moment. This consistency reduces variability in the quality of care and establishes a high standard of analysis for the entire team. Our performance is continuously validated against a demanding bank of clinical cases to ensure constant reliability.",
      "BENEFITS_6_TITLE": "Created in clinical practice, for clinical practice",
      "BENEFITS_6_TEXT": "DxGPT is not a laboratory product. It has been developed in a continuous cycle of collaboration with frontline doctors, hospitals, and scientific societies. Its design and functionalities respond to the real challenges of diagnosis, ensuring that it is not only technologically advanced, but also clinically useful, relevant, and easy to integrate into the professional's mental workflow.",

      "EVAL_TEXT_1": "Confidence in a clinical tool is not given, it is earned with rigorous evidence. At DxGPT, validation is not an event, but a continuous process. Our performance was initially evaluated in an independent clinical validation conducted by the Sant Joan de Déu Hospital, whose results, published in medRxiv, demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of clinical experts.",
      "EVAL_TEXT_2": "On that basis, we have built a Constant Validation Framework, an evaluation ecosystem designed to subject DxGPT to the challenges of real medical practice and ensure that its reliability constantly evolves.",

      "EVAL_SUBTITLE_3": "The science of asking: The secret to consistency",
      "EVAL_TEXT_5": "Our research has revealed a critical factor: the quality of an LLM's response depends decisively on the quality of the question. Therefore, we have developed and validated over 30 prompt formulations (instructions) to find the optimal structure that activates effective and consistent clinical reasoning.",
      "EVAL_TEXT_6": "This expert control over formulation is what differentiates DxGPT from a generalist AI. We do not leave the quality of the result to chance; we have designed a process that ensures that, for the same case, the system always applies the same analytical rigor, producing reliable and reproducible results.",
      "EVAL_CHART_DESCRIPTION": "The chart illustrates how our optimization of the formulation (the jump from the 4o → o3 family) not only increases accuracy (X-axis), but also allows solving cases of greater complexity (Y-axis), demonstrating a significant advance in the system's clinical reasoning ability.",
      "EVAL_SUBTITLE_4": "An evaluation methodology that thinks like a clinician",
      "EVAL_TEXT_7": "Measuring accuracy goes beyond a simple 'correct' or 'incorrect'. Our 3-level cascade evaluation process measures what really matters in clinical practice:",
      "EVAL_METHOD_1": "Objective Verification: We compare the main hypothesis with standardized medical codes (SNOMED CT, ICD-10). This is our strictest validation line.",
      "EVAL_METHOD_2": "Clinical Context Analysis: If there is no exact match, an expert AI evaluates whether the response is a valid clinical synonym (e.g., 'acute renal failure' vs. 'acute kidney injury'), recognizing successes that a simple text analysis would ignore.",
      "EVAL_METHOD_3": "Quality of Prioritization: This is our most innovative metric. It's not enough for the correct diagnosis to be on the list; we measure its average position. A correct diagnosis in the first position is infinitely more useful than in the fifth. This metric evaluates DxGPT's ability to prioritize like a specialist, offering maximum clinical relevance in the shortest possible time.",
