    "aboutUs":{
      "t0": "What problem does DxGPT solve?",
      "p0.1": "Medical diagnosis, particularly in the context of rare diseases, is often a complex and time-consuming process. Clinicians must evaluate a wide array of symptoms, analyze the patient's medical history, and interpret test results, all of which can complicate the path to an accurate diagnosis. This complexity can lead to delays in initiating the correct treatment and create uncertainty in clinical decision-making.",
      "p0.2": "Rare diseases pose an even greater challenge, as many healthcare professionals lack direct experience with these conditions due to their infrequency. With over 10,000 identified rare diseases, most of which are unfamiliar to the average clinician, the diagnostic process becomes especially daunting. In this context, the use of advanced technology to support diagnosis is no longer a luxury—it is a necessity. Having access to intelligent tools that assist in generating possible diagnoses is essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve the overall quality of care.",
      "t1": "How does DxGPT solve it?",
      "p1.1": "DxGPT leverages cutting-edge language models—such as GPT-4, developed by OpenAI—to assist in the diagnostic process. By default, it utilizes the GPT-4 model, and also integrates advanced reasoning models like o1 and o3 for even greater diagnostic precision. When a healthcare professional inputs a patient's symptoms, DxGPT analyzes the information and generates a list of likely diagnoses.",
      "p1.2": "This approach represents a paradigm shift in the design and implementation of diagnostic tools. Instead of depending on static, rule-based systems, DxGPT applies the contextual reasoning capabilities of large language and reasoning models to better emulate the clinical decision-making process. This allows it to adapt to complex cases and rare disease presentations more effectively.",
      "p1.3": "While DxGPT does not replace the expertise of medical professionals, it acts as a powerful cognitive aid—helping clinicians focus their investigations and significantly reduce the time required to arrive at an accurate diagnosis.",
      "t2": "How It Works",
      "p2.1": "When a healthcare professional inputs a patient's symptoms into DxGPT, the platform constructs a detailed prompt that is sent to a large language model (LLM). This prompt includes not only the patient's clinical presentation but also specific alignment instructions that guide the LLM to produce consistent and medically relevant responses. The LLM—whether GPT-4 or a reasoning-optimized model like o1 or o3—then processes the prompt and generates a list of potential diagnoses.",
      "p2.2": "The generated response is parsed and formatted into a clear, easy-to-interpret interface, helping clinicians quickly review the most likely diagnostic hypotheses. This structured output serves as a valuable starting point for further investigation, which may include reviewing medical history, ordering diagnostic tests, and gathering additional clinical information. User feedback is integral to refining the models and improving both the accuracy and usability of DxGPT over time.",
      "t3": "Our commitment to improvement",
      "p3.1": "DxGPT is currently an experimental platform—not a production tool. Its primary objective is to explore and evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the complex task of medical diagnosis, particularly for rare diseases. We aim to understand how these models can support clinicians, identify their limitations, and assess their real-world applicability.",
      "p3.2": "We are continuously developing new features and improving our methodologies based on rigorous testing and feedback. Collaboration is central to our mission, and we actively seek to partner with researchers, clinicians, and institutions interested in advancing the science of AI-assisted diagnostics.
