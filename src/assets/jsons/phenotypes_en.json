VSCC arises via either a human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated pathway, or more commonly, via a mechanism independent of HPV, often being linked to chronic inflammatory conditions such as lichen sclerosus (LS). Accordingly, two distinct subtypes of VIN are recognised: the HPV-associated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/usual VIN (HSIL/uVIN) and the non-HPV-associated differentiated VIN (dVIN). HSIL is clinically identified by its multifocal, warty appearance and on histology by conspicuous cytological and architectural atypia. Differentiated VIN, on the other hand, often produces ill-defined lesions, and on histology, notoriously mimics non-neoplastic epithelial disorders (NNED), particularly LS. As a result, dVIN is rarely identified in advance of a diagnosis of invasive malignancy, despite being the precursor lesion of the majority of VSCC.","id":"HP:0032202","layperson":"Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia","name":"Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia","synonyms":[]},{"desc":"A tumor (abnormal growth of tissue) of the vagina.","id":"HP:0100650","layperson":"Vaginal tumor","name":"Vaginal neoplasm","synonyms":["Vaginal neoplasia","Vaginal tumor"]},{"desc":"A type of adenocarcinoma originating in the vagina and characterized by large cells with moderate to abundant clear cytoplasm.","id":"HP:0031521","layperson":"Vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma","name":"Vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma","synonyms":["Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina"]},{"desc":"A type of adenocarcinoma originating in the cervix and characterized by large cells with moderate to abundant clear cytoplasm.","id":"HP:0031522","layperson":"Cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma","name":"Cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma","synonyms":["Clear cell carcinoma of cervix"]},{"desc":"A structural or developmental anomaly of any of the tissues involved in the genital system.","id":"HP:0012243","layperson":"Abnormal reproductive system morphology","name":"Abnormal reproductive system morphology","synonyms":["Abnormal genital system morphology"]},{"desc":null,"id":"HP:0000811","layperson":"Abnormal external genitalia","name":"Abnormal external genitalia","synonyms":["Abnormal external genitalia"]},{"desc":"An abnormality of male external genitalia.","id":"HP:0000032","layperson":"Abnormality of male external genitalia","name":"Abnormality of male external genitalia","synonyms":[]},{"desc":"Ambiguous genitalia in an individual with XY genetic gender.","id":"HP:0000033","layperson":"Ambiguous genitalia in males","name":"Ambiguous genitalia, male","synonyms":["Ambiguous genitalia in males"]},{"desc":"An anomaly of the testicle (the male gonad).","id":"HP:0000035","layperson":"Abnormality of the testis","name":"Abnormal testis morphology","synonyms":["Anomaly of the testes","Abnormality of the testis"]},{"desc":"Testis in inguinal canal.

Just as the ethmoid, including the cribriform plate, is widened and caudally displaced, the sphenoid sinus is broadened and extensively, but symmetrically pneumatized. The lateral rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid results in a relative shortening of the anteroposterior dimension of the middle cranial fossa.

A partial displacement (or dislocation) of the lens is described as a subluxation of the lens, while a complete displacement is termed luxation of the lens. A complete displacement occurs if the lens is completely outside the patellar fossa of the lens, either in the anterior chamber, in the vitreous, or directly on the retina. If the lens is partially displaced but still contained within the lens space, then it is termed subluxation.","id":"HP:0001083","layperson":"Ectopia lentis","name":"Ectopia lentis","synonyms":["Abnormality of lens position","Lens dislocation"]},{"desc":"Partial dislocation of the lens of the eye.","id":"HP:0001132","layperson":"Partially dislocated lens","name":"Lens subluxation","synonyms":["Partially dislocated lens"]},{"desc":"Partial dislocation of the lens in a superior direction.","id":"HP:0008019","layperson":"Superior lens subluxation","name":"Superior lens subluxation","synonyms":["Superior subluxated lens"]},{"desc":"Partial displacement of the lens in the inferior direction.","id":"HP:0008494","layperson":"Inferior lens subluxation","name":"Inferior lens subluxation","synonyms":["Inferior subluxated lens"]},{"desc":"Complete dislocation of the lens of the eye.","id":"HP:0012019","layperson":"Dislocated lens","name":"Lens luxation","synonyms":["Dislocated lens","Dislocated lenses"]},{"desc":"Absence or underdevelopment of the lens.","id":"HP:0008063","layperson":"Absent/small lens","name":"Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the lens","synonyms":["Absent/small lens","Absent/underdeveloped lens"]},{"desc":"Absence of the crystalline lens of the eye as a result of a developmental defect.","id":"HP:0007707","layperson":"Congenital aphakia","name":"Congenital aphakia","synonyms":["Lens agenesis"]},{"desc":"Abnormal smallness of the lens.","id":"HP:0012376","layperson":"Small lens","name":"Microphakia","synonyms":["Small lens"]},{"desc":"Lens of the eye is smaller than normal and spherically shaped.","id":"HP:0030961","layperson":"Microspherophakia","name":"Microspherophakia","synonyms":[]},{"desc":"An abnormal shape of the lens.","id":"HP:0011526","layperson":"Abnormality of lens shape","name":"Abnormality of lens shape","synonyms":["Abnormality of lens shape"]},{"desc":"A conical projection of the anterior or posterior surface of the lens, occurring as a developmental anomaly.","id":"HP:0001142","layperson":"Lenticonus","name":"Lenticonus","synonyms":[]},{"desc":"A conical projection of the anterior surface of the lens, occurring as a developmental anomaly.","id":"HP:0011501","layperson":"Anterior lenticonus","name":"Anterior lenticonus","synonyms":[]},{"desc":"A conical projection of the posterior surface of the lens, occurring as a developmental anomaly.","id":"HP:0011502","layperson":"Posterior lenticonus","name":"Posterior lenticonus","synonyms":[]},{"desc":"Exaggerated curvature of the lens of the eye, producing an anterior or posterior spherical bulging.","id":"HP:0011527","layperson":"Lentiglobus","name":"Lentiglobus","synonyms":["Bulging of eye lens"]},{"desc":"Tremulousness (trembling) of the lens of the eye.","id":"HP:0012629","layperson":"Trembling eye lens","name":"Phakodonesis","synonyms":["Phacodonesis","Trembling eye lens"]},{"desc":"The term pseudophakia refers to having an artificial lens implanted after the natural eye lens has been removed.

There are several issues involved in hypophosphatemic rickets such as calcium, vitamin D, phosphorus deficiencies. Moreover, other disorder can be associated with its occurrence such as absorption defects due to pancreatic, intestinal, gastric, and renal disorders and hepatobiliary disease. Symptoms are usually seen in childhood and can be varied in severity. Severe forms may be linked to bowing of the legs, poor bone growth, and short stature as well as joint and bone pain. Hypophosphatemic rickets are associated with renal excretion of phosphate, hypophosphatemia, and mineral defects in bones.
